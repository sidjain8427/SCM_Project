            <h3>We are not an option, we are a choice !</h3> 
            <p> Rideon is the India's leading community-based travel network enabling millions of members to share a ride in local markets. 
                Rideon leverages technology to fill empty seats on the road, connecting members looking to bikepool or to travel by bus, taxi and making travel more affordable, sociable and convenient.
                Rideon's environmentally and human-friendly mobility network will be saving tons of CO2 and enabling more human connections in coming years.
            </p> <br> 
            <h3>How it all started?</h3> 
            <p>
                When Shreshtha ,one of the founders at Ride-on.com,  was trying to get his college for End-term exams, he struggled as he had no bike and all the taxis were full.
                After begging his friend to pick him up, it was on the road when he noticed the sheer number of people driving alone. 
                It hit him that all those empty seats in existing bikes could be the beginning of a new travel network. Over the next months, 
                together with co-founders Sanjeev and Shubham, the trio took this simple idea and built it into the Indiaâ€™s leading bikepooling platform, 
                connecting millions of people going the same way.
            </p> <br>
